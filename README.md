# Service-and-Image-Classification-using-CNN-and-Deep-Learning
This project demonstrates a 🧠 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images and services based on a predefined dataset.

🎯 **Goal**: Classify different categories of images/services using deep learning.
🛠️ **Approach**: Built and trained a CNN model with a custom dataset, then evaluated its accuracy and performance.
🧰 **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Jupyter Notebook
✨ Features
✅ Custom image dataset for training, validation, and testing
✅ CNN architecture designed for high classification accuracy
✅ Model saved in `.keras` format
✅ Jupyter notebook for training and testing
✅ Plots and visualizations of accuracy/loss
✅ Preprocessing pipeline for image data
